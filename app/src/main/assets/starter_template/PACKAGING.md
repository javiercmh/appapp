# App² Runtime Packaging Contract

The starter runs as plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript inside App²'s Android WebView. The host exposes
native capabilities through `window.AndroidStorage` (also aliased as `window.AndroidMemory` and
`window.AndroidNotification`). The bundled `js/bridge.js` is the only file that should call it.

Each saved subapp runs at its own stable origin, `https://<subapp-id>.app.local/`. Files, browser
storage, bridge key-value state, notifications, and scheduled reminders are isolated by subapp ID.
The ID stays stable when the manifest name changes. Relative asset URLs and module imports continue
to work, and ZIP operations apply only to the selected app.

## Subapp AI guide

Connect ChatGPT exclusively through the **library → Settings → AI**. Editors and subapps have no account controls. All local subapps may use the connected provider. Live generation consumes ChatGPT plan usage; browser previews have `ai.available === false` and do not make AI requests unless a development mock is explicitly supplied.

Import `ai` from `js/bridge.js`. `ai.available` means the native channel exists, **not** that an account is connected. All methods below return Promises:

| Method | Resolved value |
| --- | --- |
| `ai.providers()` | `{providers: [{id: "chatgpt", name: "ChatGPT", connected: true}]}` (connection may be false) |
| `ai.models("chatgpt")` | `{models: [{id: "provider-model-id", name: "Display name", reasoningLevels: ["low", "medium", "high"]}]}` |
| `ai.start({providerId, model, instructions, input, reasoningEffort?})` | Request ID string |
| `ai.result(id)` | Pending: `{id, done: false, value: null}`; success: `{id, done: true, value: "completed text"}` |
| `ai.wait(id)` | Completed text string; only for IDs started by this page instance |
| `ai.cancel(id)` | `true`; cancels and releases the request |
| `ai.acknowledge(id)` | `true`; releases a terminal result after saving or handling failure |

Model lists are account-specific and preserve server order. Treat IDs as provider-specific; use the returned list rather than hardcoding models. `reasoningLevels` may be empty. Omit `reasoningEffort` for the provider default; explicit efforts must come from the selected model's list. The examples' model IDs and capabilities above are illustrative.

Native command failures reject with `Error`, usually with `.code` and `.message`. A cached terminal failure from `ai.result()` may instead have `{id, done: true, error: {code, message}}` (its `value` is not response text). Handle both forms. Results created in the current page may contain additional wrapper internals; persist your own metadata, not the result object. Common failure codes include `authentication`, `permission`, `usage_limit`, `network`, `service`, `invalid_response`, `models`, `invalid_request`, `provider`, `request_in_progress` and `not_found`. An unavailable browser or command timeout may reject without a code. Show failures and require a deliberate new Generate action; never automatically retry inference.

This runnable module example (placed under `js/`) saves before acknowledging:

```js
import { ai, writeFile } from './bridge.js';
export async function generateExample() {
  if (!ai.available) throw new Error('Open this app in App².');
  const { providers } = await ai.providers();
  if (!providers.some(p => p.id === 'chatgpt' && p.connected))
    throw new Error('Connect ChatGPT in the library Settings → AI.');
  const { models } = await ai.models('chatgpt');
  if (!models.length) throw new Error('No models available.');
  const id = await ai.start({providerId: 'chatgpt', model: models[0].id,
    instructions: 'Use plain language.',
    input: 'Write one short sentence explaining what a subapp is.'});
  // Persist id immediately for recovery in a production workflow.
  let text;
  try { text = await ai.wait(id); }
  catch (error) {
    await ai.acknowledge(id).catch(() => {});
    throw error;
  }
  if (!writeFile('data/example.json', {id, text}))
    throw new Error('Save failed: retain id and retry saving before acknowledgement.');
  await ai.acknowledge(id);
  return text;
}
```

The Starter Demo's `js/ai-demo.js` provides the complete recoverable workflow: `data/ai-demo.json` holds `pending` request metadata and one `latest` result containing its ID, provider, model, requested reasoning, prompt, timestamp and text. The request ID is the idempotency key. Save the JSON result first, then acknowledge, then clear pending metadata. A save failure retains the request and offers **Retry saving** without generating again. If the page is recreated or resumes, poll `ai.result(id)` for the persisted ID; `ai.wait(id)` cannot recover a prior page's ID. A missing request is interrupted; preserve any saved result and require deliberate generation. Release handled terminal failures with acknowledgement. Render generated text through `textContent`.

Listen for `app2:ai:connection` with `event.detail = {providerId, connected}` and refresh provider/model discovery. `app2:ai:status` currently reports `{id, status: "running"}`; use result polling for completion/failure, rather than assuming a completion status event. Refresh/recover on `pageshow` and `visibilitychange` when visible. These events expose no account identifiers or credentials.

The native host binds requests to the exact subapp HTTPS origin and main frame and derives subapp/task ownership. Another subapp cannot retrieve, cancel or acknowledge your request. Callers cannot provide arbitrary endpoints or authentication headers. Only one unfinished **or unacknowledged** request per subapp is allowed. Native credentials remain encrypted outside workspaces, snapshots and exports.

Requests use native Responses streaming with `store:false`; text succeeds only after `response.completed`. Switching apps or opening the sign-in browser allows the active request to continue under a foreground notification. Rotation preserves the native request. Explicit reload, final screen closure, deletion and swiping the owning task from Recent Apps cancel its requests; closing another task does not. Completed results remain available until acknowledgement or task closure. Process death, force-stop and reboot do not restart inference. Persisted IDs can become `not_found`. Web workflows after inference (validation and auto-save) resume when the web app runs again; the foreground service does not execute the whole web app in the background.

## Scheduled notifications

Use `scheduleNotification(id, triggerAtMillis, title, message)` for a reminder that must fire while
the app is closed. Pass the epoch-millisecond timestamp as a string. Reusing an ID replaces its
existing alarm; use `cancelScheduledNotification(id)` to remove it.

The host uses exact `AlarmManager` alarms. On Android 12 and later, check
`canScheduleExactNotifications()` and offer `requestExactNotificationPermission()` from a user action
when access is missing. That method opens Android's Alarms & reminders settings. Its Boolean return
reports whether the settings screen opened, not whether permission was granted. On return, listen for
`app2:alarmperm` with `event.detail.granted` or check permission again when the page resumes.
Scheduling returns `false` when exact access is missing; do not create an approximate duplicate.
Android 8 through 11 can schedule exact alarms without special access.

The host preserves pending reminders across reboot and app replacement, and re-arms them when exact
access is granted. Notification permission is separate and is checked again when a reminder fires.
Exact alarms can still be delayed by Android idle-mode limits; force-stopping App² prevents delivery
until it is opened again. A browser preview has no background scheduler and can only use a timer while
the page remains open.


## Starter Demo browser development

The Starter Demo includes `dev_server.py`. From the repository, run:

```sh
python3 app/src/main/assets/starter_template/dev_server.py
# Optional deterministic AI simulation, without credentials or ChatGPT usage:
python3 app/src/main/assets/starter_template/dev_server.py --mock-ai
```

Open `http://localhost:8888`. A positional port is also accepted, e.g. `dev_server.py 9000 --mock-ai`.
For an exported workspace, run `python3 dev_server.py` inside that workspace. The server always
serves the script's directory and binds only to localhost. Use Python 3.9 or newer, with no dependencies.

Browser file operations read/write actual workspace files, including JPEG photos; development
preferences live in `data/dev-preferences.json`. Use a disposable workspace copy for tests because
notes, photos and AI results change files on disk. The bridge probes `/__bridge/info` once; ordinary
static previews retain localStorage. After selecting the server, failed writes return false and
failed reads throw; they never silently fall back to localStorage.

`--mock-ai` enables a visibly labelled development mock and one offline model. Generate returns
fixed text after 1.5 seconds. Requests survive browser reloads while the server runs and occupy
one slot until cancellation or acknowledgement. Restarting the server loses requests; persisted
IDs then return `not_found`. No external requests are made. Mock requests do not reproduce native
task closure or background service behavior. Notifications keep browser behavior; Android
permissions, exact alarms, WebView insets and real AI must be tested on Android.

## Native GitHub subapp updates

Share & Package App is export-only. ZIP installation is available in the library
and creates a separate app. Existing apps update through native Update app,
following public GitHub package metadata in `manifest.json.app2Update`. The host
pins downloads to one commit, reviews managed changes/local edits and requires
confirmation. Managed files update; seeds copy only when absent; all unowned files
remain. `data/` can contain managed shipped definitions as well as user records,
so declare ownership explicitly. Domain records and preferences must be seeds,
never managed replacements. Publisher app identity differs from installed App² ID.

The wrapper exports `updates.available` and `updates.open()` (Promise resolving
true when native review opens). Browsers report unavailable. The owning HTTPS
origin and main frame are required; web callers cannot supply endpoints or install
silently. Finish/save/acknowledge or cancel AI requests before updating. App² 1.3.0
(version code 4) adds this channel. Native update state, full binary backups and
recovery journals live beside the workspace; ordinary history is not a full backup.
See the App² repository's `docs/SUBAPP_UPDATES.md` for publisher metadata, recovery,
version history, deterministic packaging and the phone deployment checklist.


## Text to Speech

Import `speech` from `js/bridge.js`. `speech.available` reports a supported native channel,
not engine readiness. Browser previews reject calls with `unavailable`.

- `await speech.voices()` returns `{voices: [{id, name, language, requiresNetwork}]}` from
  Android's configured TTS engine. Discover voice IDs; do not hardcode them. Online voices
  may transmit text through the configured engine and require connectivity.
- `await speech.speak({text, language, voiceId?, rate?, pitch?})` requires a BCP 47 language
  such as `fr-FR`, `de-DE`, or `ja-JP`. No language detection is performed. An explicit voice
  must match the requested language and script. Regional fallback within that language is allowed.
  Rate and pitch default to 1 and accept finite values from 0.5 to 2.
- The speak Promise resolves with `{status: "completed"}` after playback or
  `{status: "cancelled"}` after replacement/Stop. New playback replaces previous playback.
- `await speech.stop()` resolves to `true`, including when idle.
- Errors reject with `.code` and `.message`: `unavailable`, `invalid_request`, `language`,
  `missing_data`, `voice`, `network`, `synthesis`, `cancelled`, or command `timeout`.
  Missing data must be installed through Android TTS settings; do not retry automatically.
  Empty text and text beyond Android's engine input limit are rejected.

Subapps provide their own pronunciation buttons using `speech.speak({text, language})`.
App² does not add a Speak action to Android’s text selection menu.
A native **Stop** control appears during playback. Speech stops on backgrounding, page reload,
navigation, workspace replacement, or closure; it is not persisted or resumed.
The channel accepts only the owning subapp HTTPS origin and main frame. No AI account is needed.
Store any subapp voice preferences in plain JSON under `data/`. The Starter Demo includes
`js/speech-demo.js`; existing apps adopt the speech API explicitly.


### Pronunciation example

Use this in a JavaScript module under `js/`:

```js
import { speech } from './bridge.js';
if (!speech.available) throw new Error('Open this app in App² to hear pronunciation.');
try {
  const result = await speech.speak({text: 'Bonjour', language: 'fr-FR', rate: 0.8});
  // result.status is "completed" or "cancelled".
} catch (error) {
  // Show error.message; require a deliberate retry.
  console.error(error.code, error.message);
}
```

Existing workspaces are not rewritten; adopt the current wrapper explicitly to add speech buttons.


## Device Translation

Import `translation` from `js/bridge.js`. These methods return Promises:

- `await translation.availability()` returns `{available: true}` only when Android 10/API 29
  or later has an installed activity that handles `Intent.ACTION_TRANSLATE`.
- `await translation.open({text})` opens the default handler, or Android's resolver when a
  handler must be selected, and resolves to `{opened: true}` after launching it.
  It does not return translated text or confirm translation completion.

Supply canonical selected text from the subapp's own selection model. Text is forwarded unchanged;
blank text and text longer than 100000 JavaScript UTF-16 code units are rejected. Android's standard
translation intent only accepts text (`Intent.EXTRA_TEXT`): it has no source or target language
parameters. The receiving app controls language detection, target language, and translation UI.
No contextual menu action is added by App². Call `open` only after a deliberate user action.
Opening translation sends the supplied text to the selected external application.

The channel is restricted to the owning subapp HTTPS origin and main frame, and requires a
foreground app. Browser previews and unsupported hosts report `{available: false}` from
`availability()`; `open()` rejects with `unavailable`. Native failures reject with `.code` and
`.message`: `invalid_request` or `unavailable`; the wrapper may also reject with `timeout`.
Handle errors and require deliberate retry. Availability can change between checking and opening.

```js
import { translation } from './bridge.js';
translateButton.hidden = !(await translation.availability()).available;
translateButton.addEventListener('click', async () => {
  try {
    await translation.open({text: canonicalSelectedText});
  } catch (error) {
    status.textContent = error.message;
  }
});
```

Existing workspaces must explicitly adopt the updated `js/bridge.js` to use this API.

## Text Selection Menu

Import `selectionMenu` from `js/bridge.js`. `selectionMenu.available` reports a host that supports it.

- `selectionMenu.setSuppressed(true)` hides Android's floating selection menu (Copy, Select all,
  Share…) for the current page load and returns `true` when the host applied it. `false` restores it.
- Selection handles, `selectionchange` and `getSelection()` keep working. The subapp must provide
  its own actions, including Copy. The setting resets on reload or navigation: call it at startup.
- Browser previews and older hosts return `false`; keep the subapp's own selection UI visible
  in that case.
